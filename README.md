# Social Network API

![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

A NoSQL API for a social network web application that stores users, their thoughts and a friend list.

## Description

- This project is a social network API that uses Express.js routing and MongoDB database. This API is the foundation for a future social network platform and allows the developer to access all relevant information needed to create, update, modify and delete information stored in the database.
- The MongoDB database is scalable and can handle the complexity required by a social media platform. It is flexible, high performance and open source..
- This database and its associated routing allows the developer of the social media platform to quickly and clearly find and update all relevant data. The models used in this database create clear delineation of relationships between objects in the database, and can be quickly implemented in the front end build using API calls.
- The developer learned the importance of careful error handling, console logging data returns from requests and the careful implementation of data structure syntax for MongoDB.

## Installation

To run this application from the command line: first run "npm run seed" to seed the database with custom-made randomized data, then run "npm start" to start the server on your localhost (PORT 3001).

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, use a route tester such as Insomnia to test all relevant GET, PUT, DELETE and POST routes.
